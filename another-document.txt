My bet is that the mother decided to hoist the little kid up on top of the enclosure barrier so he could have a better view and lost her hold on him. There is no way a three year old got over the barrier and fell into the exhibit on his own. Of course the mother will try and claim that is what happened to avoid taking any responsibility. I also imagine that the mother will try and sue the zoo as well. I feel sorry for the poor kid who lost his life through the negligence of his mother. I am also a little outraged that some ignorant cop shot one of the dogs for simply doing what it does naturally. The kid was already dead and there was no reason to kill the dog. They could have simply waited for a qualified zookeeper to get there with a tranquilizer gun to subdue the dog and retrieve the body. Shooting and endangered animal when the animal has done nothing wrong is a crime itself and I hope that the cop is disciplined for his unwarranted actions. I figure the mom has enough punishment in having to live with the guilt of knowing that she is responsible for the death of her child, so I will not call for her to be prosecuted as well, but there is no doubt that she is the one ultimately responsible for this tragedy.
